# KBTS3AudioBot

This is a open-source TeamSpeak3 bot, playing music and much more.

## Build status

![Build and Release](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/scheissegalo/KBTS3AudioBot/dotnet.yml?branch=master&label=Build)

## Upgraded to NET 6.0

ensuring compatibility and taking advantage of the latest framework features and improvements.
This upgrade results in a more efficient application, with reduced memory usage and a significantly smaller binary size.
All vulnerabilities have been addressed and resolved during the upgrade process.

## Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot. This helps protect our community

Install this:
https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2
follow install instructions then use this as script:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Path to the yt-dlp executable in the virtual environment
YTDLP_PATH="$HOME/yt-dlp/bin/yt-dlp"

# Use the yt-dlp executable with your arguments
$YTDLP_PATH --username oauth2 --password 'yourpassword' "$@"
```

replace "yourpassword"

## YouTube Playback Configuration

### Cookie Authentication (Recommended)

Many YouTube videos now require authentication to play. The bot supports cookie-based authentication through yt-dlp.

**Configuration:**

Edit your bot configuration file (`ts3audiobot.toml` or `bots/default/bot.toml`) and set the cookie file path:

```toml
[factories.youtube]
cookie_file = "/path/to/your/cookies.txt"
```

**How to Extract Cookies from Your Browser:**

1. **Using Browser Extensions (Easiest Method):**
   - **Chrome/Edge:** Install [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)
   - **Firefox:** Install [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)
2. **Steps:**

   - Make sure you're logged into YouTube in your browser
   - Navigate to youtube.com
   - Click the extension icon
   - Click "Export" or "Download" to save cookies.txt
   - Move the file to a secure location (e.g., `/home/user/bot/cookies.txt`)
   - Update the `cookie_file` path in your bot configuration

3. **Security Note:** Keep your cookies.txt file secure! It contains your YouTube session and should not be shared.

**Alternative: Manual yt-dlp Script (Advanced Users)**

If you prefer to use a custom yt-dlp script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Path to the yt-dlp executable
YTDLP_PATH="$HOME/yt-dlp/bin/yt-dlp"

# Use the yt-dlp executable with your arguments
$YTDLP_PATH --cookies $HOME/cookies.txt "$@"
```

For more details: [how do i pass cookies to yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp) and [export YouTube cookies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies)

### Extractor Arguments (Advanced)

For additional control over YouTube extraction, you can pass custom arguments to yt-dlp:

```toml
[factories.youtube]
extractor_args = "youtube:player_client=android"
```

**Common Examples:**

- `youtube:player_client=android` - Use Android client for extraction (may bypass some restrictions)
- `youtube:player_client=ios` - Use iOS client
- `youtube:skip=hls,dash` - Skip certain stream types

Leave empty for default behavior.

## Troubleshooting YouTube Playback

### Video Won't Play

**Problem:** Bot says "No suitable format found" or video fails to play

**Solutions:**

1. **Configure Cookie Authentication:**

   - Many videos require authentication (see Cookie Authentication section above)
   - Export cookies from your browser and configure the `cookie_file` path

2. **Check yt-dlp Installation:**

   ```bash
   # Test if yt-dlp works
   yt-dlp --version

   # Test with a video
   yt-dlp -F https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
   ```

3. **Update yt-dlp:**

   ```bash
   # Update to latest version
   pip install -U yt-dlp
   # or
   yt-dlp -U
   ```

4. **Check Bot Logs:**
   - Look in the `logs` folder for detailed error messages
   - The bot logs all available formats when selection fails

### Age-Restricted or Region-Locked Videos

**Problem:** "Video requires authentication" or "Video unavailable in your region"

**Solution:** Configure cookie authentication (see above). Cookies from a logged-in YouTube account can bypass many restrictions.

### Format Selection Issues

**Problem:** Bot selects wrong quality or format

**Solution:** The bot automatically selects the best audio format based on:

1. Audio codec quality (AAC-LC preferred)
2. Audio-only streams (preferred over combined audio+video)
3. Lower video resolution for combined streams (to save bandwidth)

This is automatic and optimized for audio playback.

### Cookie File Not Found Warning

**Problem:** Bot logs "Cookie file not found: /path/to/cookies.txt"

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the file path is correct and absolute (e.g., `/home/user/cookies.txt`)
2. Check file permissions (bot needs read access)
3. Ensure the file is in Netscape cookie format
4. If you don't need cookies, set `cookie_file = ""` to disable the warning

### Internal Scraper Deprecation Warning

**Problem:** Bot logs "Internal YouTube scraper is deprecated"

**Solution:** This is informational only. The bot automatically uses yt-dlp instead. To remove the warning, change your configuration:

```toml
[factories.youtube]
prefer_resolver = "YoutubeDl"  # Change from "Internal" to "YoutubeDl"
```

## Plugins?

**You do not need any plugins, but you can use them if you wish.**
Most of them have hardcoded channels and paths, so you will need to adjust and compile them to use them.
I have already planned a real-time compiler so you can simply use .cs files directly in the plugins folder.

#### Linux

Install the required dependencies:

- on **Ubuntu**/**Debian**:  
  Run `sudo apt-get install libopus-dev ffmpeg`
- on **Arch Linux**:  
  Run `sudo pacman -S opus ffmpeg`
- on **CentOS 7**:  
  Run
  `  sudo yum -y install epel-release
  sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-5.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
  sudo yum -y install ffmpeg opus-devel`
- **manually**:
  1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed
  1. Make the Opus script runnable with `chmod u+x InstallOpus.sh` and run it with `./InstallOpus.sh`
  1. Get the ffmpeg [32bit](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-i686-static.tar.xz) or [64bit](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-amd64-static.tar.xz) binary.
  1. Extract the ffmpeg archive with `tar -vxf ffmpeg-git-*XXbit*-static.tar.xz`
  1. Get the ffmpeg binary from `ffmpeg-git-*DATE*-amd64-static/ffmpeg` and copy it into your TS3AudioBot folder.

#### Windows

1. Get the ffmpeg [32bit](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.zip) or [64bit](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-latest-win64-static.zip) binary.
1. Open the archive and copy the ffmpeg binary from `ffmpeg-latest-winXX-static/bin/ffmpeg.exe` into your TS3AudioBot folder.

### Optional Dependencies

If the bot can't play some youtube videos it might be due to some embedding restrictions which are blocking this.  
You can install the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) binary or source folder (and specify the path in the config) to try to bypass this.

### First time setup

1. Run the bot with `./TS3AudioBot` (Linux) or `TS3AudioBot.exe` (Windows) and follow the setup instructions.
1. (Optional) Close the bot and configure your `rights.toml` to your desires.
   You can use the template rules as suggested in the automatically generated file,
   or dive into the rights syntax [here](https://github.com/scheissegalo/TS3AudioBot/wiki/Rights).
   Then start the bot again.
1. (Optional, but highly recommended for everything to work properly).
   - Create a privilege key for the ServerAdmin group (or a group which has equivalent rights).
   - Send the bot in a private message `!bot setup <privilege key>`.
1. Congratz, you're done! Enjoy listening to your favourite music, experimenting with the crazy command system or do whatever you whish to do ;).

- OSL allows you to link to our libraries without needing to disclose your own project, which might be useful if you want to use the TSLib as a library.
- If you create plugins you do not have to make them public like in GPL. (Although we would be happy if you shared them :)
- With OSL we want to allow you providing the TS3AB as a service (even commercially). We do not want the software to be sold but the service. We want this software to be free for everyone.
